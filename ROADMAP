v0.1.0

Core:
#3: Implement optimized options
     In order to avoid recalculating the checksums again, the
      transfer command could omit the --checksum argument, compile a
      --files-from list instead of an --exclude-from list, and use
      --ignore-times to force updating the files whose size and
      timestamp are the same (the only difference is the checksum)
     The --checksum option in the --help message still needs a help description
#13: What is the maximum size of the data that stdout can host?
#14: Check that terminating syncere with Ctrl+c (and other common ways?) also
     terminates the rsync commands
#15: Preview rsync command: use sys.exit(call.returncode) instead of raising
     RsyncError?
#17: Add a transfer mode that writes a file object and feeds it to the
     transfer command's --*-from options with stdinput; of course this
     requires that stdinput is not used for some other reason (see also #18)
#18: Pass the original sys.stdin, if present, to the transfer command (see also
     #17)
#19: Test what happens in case of an error in the transfer rsync commands
     Ensure that rsync's return code is the one returned when the whole syncere
     process exits
#23: Optionally delete the *-from files after the transfer command completes
     Allow choosing at what path they are created
     Protect from exceptions that may be raised when creating them
      (permissions etc.)
      Also warn if the file already exists
#39: Optionally remove the --info=skip option from the preview command?

Interface:
#4: Document the filters syntax in the 'help' message of the commands that
     support it
#6: Support all the ruleset path types and the itemized wildcards
    Use fnmatch for globbing patterns
    Allow wildcards in the itemized representation
    Allow to omit the itemized representation if only the path should
    be tested
#8: Rules: allow enclosing the path in some character, e.g. in quotes, for
    example for paths that end with spaces, since they would be at risk
    of being trimmed by text editors
    The syntax could be e.g. 'p"path/to/file"', i.e. if a colon is
    used, than the path is expected to end at the line break; if a
    double quote is used, then the path is expected to end with '"$"
    Other supported characters/separators can be <>, all parentheses,
    or the path could be always started with '/', etc.
#24: Disable the transfer modes that use --exclude or --include options when
     the number of paths to be filtered is greater than a certain number
     Make this compatible with the --default-mode 'S' command
#26: The default transfer mode should be an "auto" mode, choosing the best
      transfer mode based on the number of included or excluded changes in the
      list
     The command could be 'Sa' or 'S*'
#25: If an interactive command doesn't accept arguments, it shouldn't execute
     if some are given; e.g. if 'qabc' or 'quit' are passed, 'q' shouldn't be
     executed; same goes for 'h'
     Also the commands that accept filters shouldn't execute at all if part of
     a filter is wrong; currently, something like '>5,a,6' does select 5 and 6
#34: Add an interactive command to preview the actual rsync command that
     would be used with 'S', but remind that Popen takes care of
     escaping characters
     See also #64
#38: Allow testing the transfer command with the --dry-run option
#44: Allow displaying the output of the preview command with the --list-only
     option (and mention this in the --help message, because --list-only is in
     the unsupported group)
#64: Make the Interface the main object, and manage everything from there
     For example also make a 'preview' command, calling it the first time
      automatically, but also allowing to call it again without having to
      restart syncere. Another possible name could be 'refresh'
     In this case, the 'transfer' command shouldn't quit syncere
     Also allow editing the commands interactively
     The preset pending-change rules should be re-executed after a refresh;
      maybe the whole configuration script should be reloaded?
     Maybe if the --command option is given, no other commands should be run
      by default, e.g. 'preview' or 'list'; this would also allow setting
      preview parameters normally through syncere commands, without the need
      for additional command-line options
     See also #34


v0.2.0

Core:
#12: Preview rsync command: Display a dynamic "processing..." message in a
      separate thread, using \r to refresh the line
#28: Implement more shared command-line options 
     --verbose could decide whether the non itemized-change lines should be
      printed when parsing the preview command results
#29: Maybe there are some more rsync options that can be specified multiple
      times, but for the moment syncere accepts them only once; test what
      happens if they're specified multiple times and properly modify
      cliargs.py as needed
#37: Implement experimental options
#48: Move most shared options to transfer-only

Interface:
#10: Paginate the change preview lists in the interface; allow setting the
     limit of changes per page
#11: Use colors to show the pending changes in the interface; allow disabling
     them

Tests:
#1: Test that the various application stages are reached
    Store more attributes and test them against expected values
#9: Check that all the raised exceptions and sys.exit calls are tested
#45: The TestRsyncOptions test could be skipped, since it doesn't depend on the
     development of syncere
#49: Test with pexpect


v1.0.0

Core:
#40: Improve error messages, show more information to ease troubleshooting
     In InvalidRuleError also show the line number in the ruleset file
     Also check the sys.exit calls, and print a Usage line in case of bad
     command-line options (this should be solved in forwarg actually)
#41: Use a proper logging system (both on stdout and file)
     Maybe share the --log-file option with rsync and append to the same file
     See also #46 and #47
#42: Test if the %B argument of --out-format shows ACLs like ls -l

Docs:
# Implement a man(1) page (also a separate (5) page for ruleset syntax?)
  Note that syncere(1) is referred from the --help message
  Move most info from the --help message, keeping only very brief reminders
   there
  http://pandoc.org/
  https://github.com/rtomayko/ronn
  https://github.com/sunaku/md2man
# Suggest that it's possible to transfer the new data into an empty folder,
  and then process it separately (--compare-dest argument)
  Create a small utility that shows a diff for the files?
# Suggest that it's possoble to bypass the interface if there are no
      undecided pending changes left after applying the rules (i.e.
      sync without confirmation) by simply adding the 'transfer' command to
      the --command options
# Mention syncere in http://superuser.com/questions/282942/make-rsync-wait-for-a-confirmation-before-actually-changing-files


v1.0.1

Style:
#56: The interactive menu commands and the '?' '!' '>' symbols shouldn't be
     hard-coded, but centralized constants should be used in their place


v1.1.0

Core:
#20: Allow choosing whether rulesets are applied in a cascading
     (last one wins) or rsync mode (first one wins)
#22: Print the rsync preview process' output in real time, but watch out for
     the deadlock problems!!!
     https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/subprocess.html
     Is rsync's --outbuf option helpful?
#27: Properly reflect rsync's ambivalent meaning of the -h option, and update
    --help's message to mention that it's supported
#36: Is the --fuzzy option useful in the preview command? Would it slow the
     command down for no advatage? If so, offer an option to use it only in
     the transfer command
#61: Ability to choose the synchronization direction per file if only one
     source is given (akin to Unison)
#46: Can --log-file-format accept an empty string as a value? forwarg
     wouldn't support that for the moment
#47: Allow removing the --log-file option in the preview rsync command
     See also #41
#63: See if the --timeout and --contimeout options can be enabled also for the
     preview command

Interface:
#30: Add more filters to the commands that act on a selection of changes, e.g.
      only show included, excluded or undecided changes
     Other possible filters: show only the root items; show only the children
      of a directory; show only the descendants of a directory
     Maybe a directory tree should be created during the
      initial parse of the --itemize-changes output
     It would be nice to also recognize ranges that end with '-', e.g. "3-"
      could mean "select from 3 to the end"
#31: When applying an interactive action on a directory, it should be possible
     to apply the change recursively to its descendants
     See also the related TODO comments in interface.py
#33: Allow opening and editing the pending changes in an external text
     editor (chosen with the $EDITOR environment variable)
#35: It should be possible to write a files-from or exclude-from
     file from the interactive menu (i.e. without necessarily executing 'S')
#100: Internationalization: allow localizing all the messages

Tests:
#60: This feature request is actually for the typein.cmenu module
     In the 'commands' parameter of the main Syncere class, used to pass
     automatic interactive commands for testing, support adding in the list a
     value such as 'True' to allow the user to enter a command interactively
     through the normal input prompt in the loop above (i.e. instead of having
     the command added automatically); maybe a new special interactive command
     should also be added for testing sessions, to restart the execution of the
     'test' list (e.g. 'T: resume the testing commands list')
