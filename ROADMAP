v0.1.0

Core:
#5: The --ruleset option must work with set names in specific configuration
     directories, e.g. ~/.config/syncere/ ; currently instead it accepts a path
     to a file
    A --rules-from option could anyway be added to really point to a file.
    Alternatively a path could be checked if no rulesets with the given name
     are found in the configuration directories (a path can be forced by using
     '/' in the value)
    Similarly, a --rule option could be used in the vein of the --filter,
     --exclude and --include options 
    These options should however all respect the cascading order with each
     other
#6: Support all the ruleset path types and the itemized wildcards
    Use fnmatch for globbing patterns
#7: Rules: allow wildcards in the itemized representation
    Allow to omit the itemized representation if only the path should
    be tested
#8: Rules: allow enclosing the path in some character, e.g. in quotes, for
    example for paths that end with spaces, since they would be at risk
    of being trimmed by text editors
    The syntax could be e.g. 'p"path/to/file"', i.e. if a colon is
    used, than the path is expected to end at the line break; if a
    double quote is used, then the path is expected to end with '"$"
    Other supported characters/separators can be <>, all parentheses,
    or the path could be always started with '/', etc.
#28: Implement more shared command-line options 
     --verbose could decide whether the non itemized-change lines should be
      printed when parsing the preview command results
#29: Maybe there are some more rsync options that can be specified multiple
      times, but for the moment syncere accepts them only once; test what
      happens if they're specified multiple times and properly modify
      cliargs.py as needed
#3: Implement optimized options
     In order to avoid recalculating the checksums again, the
      transfer command could omit the --checksum argument, compile a
      --files-from list instead of an --exclude-from list, and use
      --ignore-times to force updating the files whose size and
      timestamp are the same (the only difference is the checksum)
     The --checksum option in the --help message still needs a help description
#37: Implement experimental options
#12: Preview rsync command: also capture stderr?
#13: Preview rsync command: Display a dynamic "processing..." message in a
      separate thread, using \r to refresh the line
     What is the maximum size of the data that stdout
      can host?
#14: Check that terminating syncere with Ctrl+c (and other common ways?) also
     terminates the rsync commands
#15: Preview rsync command: use sys.exit(call.returncode) instead of raising
     RsyncError?
#17: Also allow writing file objects and feeding them to the
     transfer command's --*-from options with stdinput; of course this
     requires that stdinput is not used for some other reason (see also #18)
#18: Pass the original sys.stdin, if present, to the transfer command (see also
     #17)
#19: Test what happens in case of an error in the transfer rsync commands
     Ensure that rsync's return code is the one returned when the whole syncere
     process exits
#23: Optionally delete the *-from files after the transfer command completes
     Allow choosing at what path they are created
     Protect from exceptions that may be raised when creating them
      (permissions etc.)
      Also warn if the file already exists
#24: Disable the transfer modes that use --exclude or --include options when
     the number of paths to be filtered is greater than a certain number
     Make this compatible with the --default-mode 'S' command

Interface:
#4: In the 'h' (help) screen document that some interactive options take
     parameters (#,#-#,#,# or *)
    Also document the various S* transfer subcommands
#25: If an interactive command doesn't accept arguments, it shouldn't execute
     if some are given; e.g. if 'qabc' or 'quit' are passed, 'q' shouldn't be
     executed; same goes for 'h'
     Also the commands that accept filters shouldn't execute at all if part of
     a filter is wrong; currently, something like '>5,a,6' does select 5 and 6
#38: Allow testing the transfer command with the --dry-run option
#44: Allow displaying the output of the preview command with the --list-only
     option (and mention this in the --help message, because --list-only is in
     the unsupported group)
#39: Instead of using a --show-identical option, make that feature accessible
     as a filter of list commands, see also #30
#43: Instead of a --default-mode option, use a --configuration option (or just
      override rsync's unsupported --config option) to pass a list of
      configuration options
     Similarly, implement a --configuration-from option (or --config-from)
     Maybe also implement interactive configuration commands, and use the
      --configuration option to pass some of these commands, separated by
      commas


v0.2.0

Interface:
#10: Paginate the change preview lists in the interface; allow setting the
     limit of changes per page
#11: Use colors to show the pending changes in the interface; allow disabling
     them

Tests:
#1: Test that the various application stages are reached
#9: Check that all the raised exceptions and sys.exit calls are tested


v1.0.0

Core:
#40: Improve error messages, show more information to ease troubleshooting
     In InvalidRuleError also show the line number in the ruleset file
     Also check the sys.exit calls, and print a Usage line in case of bad
     command-line options (this should be solved in forwarg actually)
#41: Use a proper logging system
#42: Test if the %B argument of --out-format shows ACLs like ls -l

Docs:
# Implement a man(1) page (also a separate (5) page for ruleset syntax?)
  Note that syncere(1) is referred from the --help message
# Suggest that it's possible to transfer the new data into an empty folder,
  and then process it separately (--compare-dest argument)
  Create a small utility that shows a diff for the files?
# Mention syncere in http://superuser.com/questions/282942/make-rsync-wait-for-a-confirmation-before-actually-changing-files


v1.0.1

Style:
#56: The interactive menu commands and the '?' '!' '>' symbols shouldn't be
     hard-coded, but centralized constants should be used in their place


v1.1.0

Core:
#20: Allow choosing whether rulesets are applied in a cascading
     (last one wins) or rsync mode (first one wins)
#21: Allow optionally bypassing the interface if there are no
     undecided pending changes left after applying the rules (i.e.
     sync without confirmation)
#22: Print the process' output in real time, but watch out for the
     deadlock problems!!!
     https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/subprocess.html
#27: Properly reflect rsync's ambivalent meaning of the -h option, and update
    --help's message to mention that it's supported
#36: Is the --fuzzy option useful in the preview command? Would it slow the
     command down for no advatage? If so, offer an option to use it only in
     the transfer command
#61: Ability to choose the synchronization direction per file if only one
     source is given (akin to Unison)
#62: Reconsider enabling the -M/--remote-option flag as experimental or
     transfer-only

Interface:
#30: In some interactive commands it should be possible to use filters, e.g.
      only show included, excluded or undecided changes
     Other possible filters: show only the root items; show only the children
      of a directory; show only the descendants of a directory
     Maybe a directory tree should be created during the
      initial parse of the --itemize-changes output
     It would be nice to also recognize ranges that end with '-', e.g. "3-"
      could mean "select from 3 to the end"
     See also #39
#31: When applying an interactive action on a directory, it should be possible
     to apply the change recursively to its descendants
     See also the related TODO comments in interface.py
#32: Also allow specifying transfer rules (like in rule sets) through
     interactive commands
#33: Allow opening and editing the pending changes in an external text
     editor (chosen with the $EDITOR environment variable)
#34: Add an interactive command to preview the actual rsync command that
     would be used with 'S', but remind that Popen takes care of
     escaping characters
#35: It should be possible to write a files-from or exclude-from
     file from the interactive menu (i.e. without necessarily executing 'S')

Tests:
#60: In the 'test' parameter of the main Syncere class, used to pass automatic
     interactive commands for testing, support adding in the list a value such
     as 'True' to allow the user to enter a command interactively through the
     normal input prompt in the loop above (i.e. instead of having the command
     added automatically); maybe a new special interactive command should also
     be added for testing sessions, to restart the execution of the 'test' list
     (e.g. 'T: resume the testing commands list')


v1.8.0

#80: interface.py imports readline to enable the history of interactive
     commands; it's however possible to go beyond this and enable a completer
     etc., see the documentation
#100: Internationalization: allow localizing all the messages
